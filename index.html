                     Balaji Srinivasan made a shocking claim that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach the price of $1 million in the following three months, many in the <a href="#" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-weight-bold"> crypto</a> community became intrigued, wondering if his prediction could truly materialize.
                  </p>
                  <p>As the guesswork continued en masse, some analysts have turned to OpenAI’s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform <a href="#" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-weight-bold">ChatGPT</a> for suggestions, so the Finbold team decided to give it a shot as well, and the results were indeed <a href="#" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-weight-bold">bullish</a>, although far from the $1 million touted by some individuals.</p>
                  <h2>$300,000 in cards?</h2>
                  <p>As always, upon being asked to offer hypothetical <a href="#" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-weight-bold"> average Bitcoin</a> predictions for each year in the 2024-2030 period, ChatGPT warned it was only an AI language model and, as such, could not “predict future Bitcoin prices with certainty or accuracy,” but it ultimately did manage to deliver some interesting rounded up numbers.</p>
                  <p>According to the figures provided by the AI tool, Bitcoin is expected to reach the price of $150,000 in 2024, adding around $25,000 every following year until it (speculatively) hits a very enticing number of $300,000 in 2030, as per the query posted on March 29.</p>
                  <a href="#" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img1.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="left_img"></a>
                  <p>Although this prognosis is indeed very optimistic, others have gotten even more bullish responses from ChatGPT. Specifically, Twitter user Priced in Bitcoin had earlier shared an exceptionally optimistic prediction reportedly retrieved from the chatbot, which sees the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset changing hands at the price of $1 million by 2030.</p>
                  <a href="#" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img2.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="left_img"></a>
                  <p>As a reminder, this is the same number envisioned by Balaji Srinivasan, albeit on a much longer time scale. Having said that, Finbold was unable to replicate this same response by ChatGPT despite using diverse and numerous prompts.</p>
